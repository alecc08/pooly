# Pooly

**Pool & spa maintenance tracker — self-hosted**

*(the app itself supports English and French via an in-app language toggle — this documentation is English-only)*

## 🙏 About this fork

Pooly was created by [aurel-f](https://github.com/aurel-f) — go check out the
[original repository](https://github.com/aurel-f/pooly). This fork exists to move a bit
faster and rewrite the documentation in English; the underlying app and its features trace
directly back to aurel-f's work.

If you like this project, please star and contribute to the **original repo** — that's
where it all started, and that's the best way to support the person who built it.

### 🚧 What this fork has added

On top of the original app, this fork has added:

- **Home Assistant integration** — a custom component (installable via HACS) that exposes your water parameters as sensors, plus a public API for it
- **Salt pool mode** — dedicated salt water generator (SWG) support with combined chlorine tracking and pool volume
- **Per-installation units** — configurable temperature, salt, concentration and hardness units per pool/spa
- **Full English localization** — the app UI, config flow, and this documentation were rewritten/translated to English, with a FR/EN language toggle in-app
- **Multi-installation management** — ability to delete a pool/spa installation from the sidebar
- **Configurable ideal ranges** — override any water-parameter range (pH, chlorine, salt, CYA, etc.) via environment variables instead of touching code
- **CI** — a GitHub Actions workflow that lints, builds and tests the web app and API on every PR

### 🌊 Overview

Pooly is a **self-hosted** web application to track the maintenance of your pools and spas. Log your water measurements, treatments and maintenance tasks from a clean dashboard — your data stays on your own server.

Designed for owners who want full control without complexity: one Docker command and you're up and running.

---

### ✨ Features

- **Full dashboard** — KPIs, real-time water parameters, visual water quality indicator
- **AquaChek test strip input** — interactive color chart for pH, Alkalinity, Bromine, Chlorine and Hardness
- **Digital device input** — decimal inputs with range validation
- **Multi-installation** — manage multiple pools and spas with adapted reference ranges
- **Bromine, chlorine or salt** — differentiated ideal ranges per sanitizer, including salt water generator (SWG) pools, with free-chlorine targets set for the higher CYA a salt system runs at
- **Full history** — monthly timeline, type filters, full-text search
- **Measurements page** — track parameter trends over time
- **Dark mode** — light, dark or automatic theme (system preference)
- **PWA** — installable on mobile, bottom navigation, bottom sheet modal
- **Self-hosted & private** — no third-party cloud, no tracking, your data stays yours

### 🚀 Quick start

**Requirements**: Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alecc08/pooly.git
cd pooly

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Set your passwords and secrets

# 3. Start Pooly
docker compose up -d

# 4. Open in your browser
open http://localhost:8090
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:8090`. Create your account on first login.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | — |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Session secret key | — |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Public app URL | `http://localhost:8090` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins | `http://localhost:8090` |
| `DEBUG` | Debug mode (logs reset links) | `false` |

> ⚠️ **Never commit your `.env` file**. It is already in `.gitignore`.

#### Overriding ideal water-parameter ranges

Every ideal/acceptable range shown in the app (pH, free chlorine, salt, CYA, alkalinity, hardness, temperature...) has sensible built-in defaults per installation type and sanitizer — including a salt water generator (SWG) profile with a higher CYA target (60-80 ppm) and a matching free-chlorine band, following [PoolMath](https://www.troublefreepool.com/blog/poolmath/) / Trouble Free Pool guidance. If your setup runs differently, you can override any band without touching code:

```bash
# Example: your salt cell runs happily at a higher salt level than the default
RANGE_POOL_SALT_SALT_IDEAL_MIN=3600
RANGE_POOL_SALT_SALT_IDEAL_MAX=4400
```

The naming convention is `RANGE_<TYPE>_<SANITIZER>_<PARAM>_{IDEAL,ACCEPTABLE}_{MIN,MAX}` — see the commented examples in `.env.example` for the full list of types, sanitizers and parameter codes.

### 🏠 Home Assistant Integration

Pooly's water measurements can be pulled into Home Assistant as sensors.

1. **Install via HACS**
   Settings → HACS → custom repositories (⋮ menu) → add repository URL `https://github.com/alecc08/pooly`, category **Integration** → find "Pooly" in HACS → Install.

2. **Add the integration**
   Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → search for "Pooly".

3. **Configure**
   - **Base URL**: your Pooly server URL. If you're running behind the bundled nginx/reverse-proxy setup, this **must include the `/api` path** — e.g. `https://your-domain/api`, not just `https://your-domain`. Using the domain without `/api` will result in a "failed to connect to the Pooly server" error.
   - **API Key**: generate one from Settings → API Key in the Pooly web app.

4. **Result**
   Once added, you'll get a Sensors card with your installation's water parameters:

   ![Home Assistant sensors](docs/screenshots/ha-sensors.png)

5. **Display on a dashboard (optional)**
   Pooly's integration only exposes the raw sensor entities — for a nicer pool-specific dashboard widget, pair it with the [Pool Monitor Card](https://github.com/wilsto/pool-monitor-card) (installable via HACS as a frontend repository). Use the Pooly sensors as the card's data source to get a purpose-built pool/spa display.
