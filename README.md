## 🙏 About this fork

Pooly was created by [aurel-f](https://github.com/aurel-f) — go check out the
[original repository](https://github.com/aurel-f/pooly). This fork exists to move a bit
faster and rewrite the documentation in English; the underlying app and its features trace
directly back to aurel-f's work.

If you like this project, please star and contribute to the **original repo** — that's
where it all started, and that's the best way to support the person who built it.
